# Retail Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

## Overview
This project explores retail customer data to categorize customers effectively using K-means clustering. The dataset contains crucial details such as customer ID, age, gender, income, and spending score. The primary objective is to leverage this retail customer data to determine the optimal method of dividing the consumer population into meaningful clusters.

This dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

##  Project Highlights
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project begins with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics and distributions of the features within the dataset.

* K-means Clustering: Utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on specified criteria. This technique aims to identify patterns and similarities among customers.

* Interpretation of Results: The final phase involves interpreting the clustered data, providing insights into customer behavior, preferences, and potential business strategies.
